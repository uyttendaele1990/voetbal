Such changes or modifications shall be made effective for all Subscribers upon posting of the modified Agreement to this web address (URL): https://voetbal.be/terms.

    Details regarding your account can be found in your account control panel (https://www.website.com/sign-in/)
   <h2> 3. Web Hosting</h2>

    All voetbal.be web hosting accounts will display a "Coming Soon" web page by default when activated. This page informs visitors that the Subscriber has recently setup their account with voetbal.be. The "Coming Soon" default index web page may be removed by the Subscriber at any time once they have access to the web server. The "Coming Soon" web page may include, but without limitation to, the following:
        Links to additional products and services offered by voetbal.be.

        An internet search engine interface.

        Links to additional products and services offered by voetbal.be.
        Advertisements for products and services offered by third-parties.

In such cases, the expiry date of your hosting service will be adjusted according to the billing term that you have requested. Any optional features for your hosting plan will be billed according to the term that you have requested.

    If your hosting plan includes a free domain name, you will be required to pay a fee to reimburse voetbal.be for the domain name registration upon changing to another hosting plan or a billing term that does not include a free domain name. The amount of this fee will vary depending on the domain extension and on the registration term.
